jarminal(terminal -te +ja) :))

    Now I have always wanted to be able to do something like this
    java -e 'System.out.println(new Date());'

    And also do somemore complex stuff like you can using the python terminal

    And then there is jarminal....

    What I want to achieve is a java terminal, what we can easily call a java interpreter.

    Now there are two ways to go about this.....
    THE HARD WAY
        Write a new java intepreter, that can parse java statetment and then compile and do all those hard things"

    THE EASY WAY
        Write a script, 
        the script will create a file, 
        put the line in the file, where appropriate
        call javac
        report errors if there any
        call java
        display output

    I am going with the easy way since I am not a Martin Odersky

    I am of the opinion that using bash scripting, sed, grep and gawk....I will achieve what I want.
    But what about cross-platformity?? who cares, M$ sucks anyway....

    Dont mind me....what I want now is someone who can port it to windows. I am ready and equipped to do the linux version.
        ......or so i thought
